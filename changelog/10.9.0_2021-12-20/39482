Bugfix: Load l10n js files from the correct app folder

With this PR, we ensure that the translations will be loaded from the correct
app folder path.
For example, if you have two versions of an app, where one version is in the
apps folder and the other one in the apps-external folder.
The change also ensures that theme translations will be loaded additionally
instead of replacing the whole app translations.
This has the advantage that the user can cherry-pick single words to translate.
