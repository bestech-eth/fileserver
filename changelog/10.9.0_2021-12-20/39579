Enhancement: Add user:home:list-dirs and user:home:list-users commands

Added two new users commands:

* `occ user:home:list-dirs` List all homes which are currently used by users
* `occ user:home:list-users <path>` List all users who have their home in a given path
* `occ user:home:list-users --all` List all users for every home path
