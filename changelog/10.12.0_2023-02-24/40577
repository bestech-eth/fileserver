Enhancement: Add support for OCM via ScienceMesh


We've added an if-statement in the files_sharing ShareesController
code that searches for remote sharees. When the config entry
`sharing.remoteShareesSearch` is set to the name of a class
that is registered in the server container and that implements
`IRemoteShareesSearch`, for instance the 'ScienceMeshSearchPlugin'
that the 'sciencemesh' app registers, use it instead of the
federatedfilesharing app to find sharee matches for OCM sharing.
