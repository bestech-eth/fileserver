Bugfix: Adjust request body options for Guzzle7

In Guzzle major version 7 the body option of a request must be a string
or similar. Requests that send arrays of items have been adjusted to use the
form_params option. Developers of apps that use lib/private/Http/Client/IClient.php
should check any calls to ensure that arrays of items are not passed in the body
option. See the diffs of PHP docs in the linked PR for examples.
