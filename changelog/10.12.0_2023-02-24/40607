Bugfix: Use correct themed l10n app folder when app lives outside of server root

When an app_path is pointing outside of the ownCloud server root or uses an
symlink under certain conditions the l10n folder points to an invalid location
and results in a crash of the server. This happened due to the assumption that
app paths always start with the server root path.
