Enhancement: Drag & Drop folders into public file upload

Previously only files were accepted via drag & drop.
Users can now also drag folders into a public link that has the filedrop flag.
When adding a folder, the hierarchy is flattened out and
all files are added without any subfolders. Name collisons are avoided as usual.
