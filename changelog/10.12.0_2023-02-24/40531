Enhancement: Persistent major file version workflow

- Restore operation logic changed. Now restore is creating new current version of the file from one of past noncurrent versions of the file. Current version also receives incremented mtime for the file, and author of the files is the user that restored the file. The old noncurrent version is no longer removed upon restore and current version no longer receives mtime of the version.
- The current version of the file is now shown in the Versions Tab, highlighted with "gray" background
- Versions now persist additional extended metadata on versioning tags, that allow easier identification of the versions. Each update increases minor version for the file.
Current version of the file now can be published, which increases major version tag. 
- Each new edit of the file would create noncurrent versions. The ones tagged with major version due to publishing, will be persisted long term and wont be subject to any retention policies.
- Migrate from deprecated save_version_author to save_version_metadata
