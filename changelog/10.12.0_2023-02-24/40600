Bugfix: Fix orientation of images with exif data

Some images with a large exif data had problems with the orientation
when they were shown. This was caused by the native function failing
to retrieve the exif data. Images with small exif data didn't have
this problem.

By making the chunk size of the stream bigger, the native function
is able to load the exif data properly and return the information, and
with such information we can fix the orientation of the image.
