Bugfix: Align to new accounts.google.com authorization URI

Core 10.12.1 brought an update of the google/apiclient from version 2.12.6 to 2.13.1. However, in version 2.13.0 the accounts.google.com authorization URI has been updated. This change breaks old code that uses the "setApprovalPrompt('force')" instead of the newer "setPrompt('consent')" method, as this endpoint does not support the legacy approval prompt parameter. This has been now fixed.
