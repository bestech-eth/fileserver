Enhancement: Improve X-Robots-Tag header values check

Setup checks now allows other values other than "none" for X-Robots-Tag header.
If "none" or "noindex" and "nofollow" are missing, a security warning is raised.
Previously a header value with "noindex" and "nofollow" wasn't allowed even though it was valid.
