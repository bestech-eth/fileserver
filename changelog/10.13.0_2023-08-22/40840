Bugfix: Rely on the server to sort the user list

Previously, the user list was sorted in the browser. This was causing
confusion because the sorting happened with just the items being shown
without taking into account all the items, so there were some weird effects.

There is no sorting in the browser now. The server is expected to return
the list of users already sorted, so the browser just needs to show the list.
