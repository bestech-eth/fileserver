Bugfix: Explicitly set open mode in the checksum wrapper

Uploading files to some external storages through the desktop client
was causing issues due to the checksum wrapper. We're using additional
wrappers and the mode wasn't being detected correctly in some cases.
Using the right mode in the checksum wrapper was required in order to
decide whether we should discard the final checksum or not; in this case,
the checksum was being discarded, so it was causing a checksum mismatch.

Now the open mode in the checksum wrapper is set explicitly.
