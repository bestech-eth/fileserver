Bugfix: Bump files app version

Files app version was not properly increased when the "OCA\Files\BackgroundJob\CleanupPersistentFileLock" and "OCA\Files\BackgroundJob\PreviewCleanupJob" background jobs were originally added. As a result, those two jobs were not correctly inserted into the "oc_jobs" table upon a core upgrade. First time installations are not affected as there jobs are correctly added.
