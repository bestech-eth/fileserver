Enhancement: Added occ command to remove obsolete storages

Metadata coming from storages are stored in the DB. When a storage has been
removed from ownCloud, that metadata remains in the DB.

The new occ command allows you to remove that metadata stored, reducing
the amount of space used by the DB as well as slightly improving the
performance since there will be less entries.
