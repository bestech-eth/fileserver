Enhancement: Enforce 2-factor authentication

2-factor authentication can be enforced now. The feature requires at least
an app implementing the 2-factor, otherwise no enforcement will be done.
If the 2-factor authentication is enforced, all users will be required to
use a 2-factor authentication app. Some specific groups selected by the admin
can be excluded to let those users bypass the 2-factor authentication.
