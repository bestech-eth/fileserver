Bugfix: Exit with success when signing-key has been set

The "occ security:sign-key:create" command exited with status 1 even when the
signing key was successfully created. This has been corrected. The command
now exits with status zero (0) when the command succeeded.

For all occ commands, zero (0) is success, any other value indicates a problem.
